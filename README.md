# Calculator
This project is a basic calculator app built using Android Studio and Java. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing arithmetic calculations on Android devices.

## Features

* Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Multi-Digit Input: Allows users to enter numbers with multiple digits, dynamically adjusting font size for better display.
* Clear and Delete: Provides buttons to clear the input (AC) and delete individual digits (Clear).
* Error Handling: Handles invalid expressions and displays "Invalid Expression" message.
* Calculation Logic: Employs stacks to evaluate infix expressions, ensuring correct operator precedence.

## Technologies Used

* Android Studio: The official IDE for Android app development.
* Java: The primary programming language used for this project.
* Android SDK: Provides the necessary tools and APIs for Android development.
 
## How it Works
The app captures user input via buttons, dynamically updating the input display. It adjusts font size based on input length. When the equals button is pressed:
1. The input string is converted to a valid mathematical expression.
2. The expression is evaluated using a stack-based algorithm, respecting operator precedence.
3. The result is displayed in the output window.
4. Error handling is implemented to catch invalid expressions.
